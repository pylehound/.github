const counterElement = document.getElementById('document-counter'); let targetCount = 0; // The actual number of documents processed based on time let currentDisplayedCount = 0; // The number currently shown on the page (animates towards targetCount) function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) { return Math.random() \* (max - min) + min; } // Function to smoothly update the displayed number function animateCounter() { // Calculate the difference between the target and the current displayed number const diff = targetCount - currentDisplayedCount; // If the displayed number is less than the target number if (diff > 0) { // Calculate a step size. This makes the counter move faster when it's further behind. // We use Math.ceil to ensure the step is at least 1, so it always progresses. // The divisor (e.g., 15) controls the smoothness/speed of the animation. // Smaller divisor = faster catch-up, larger divisor = smoother. const smoothingFactor = 15; // Adjust this value for desired animation speed const step = Math.ceil(diff / smoothingFactor); // Increment the displayed count by the calculated step currentDisplayedCount += step; // Prevent the displayed count from overshooting the target if (currentDisplayedCount > targetCount) { currentDisplayedCount = targetCount; } // Update the text content of the span elemen counterElement.textContent = Math.ceil(currentDisplayedCount); } else { // If diff is 0 or negative (shouldn't happen with this logic, but good practice) // Ensure the displayed count is exactly the target if it somehow matches currentDisplayedCount = targetCount; counterElement.textContent = Math.ceil(currentDisplayedCount); // Explicitly set just in case } // Request the next animation frame. This creates a loop that runs // optimally for rendering animations in the browser. requestAnimationFrame(animateCounter); } // Start the animation loop. This function will call itself repeatedly. requestAnimationFrame(animateCounter); // Set up the interval to update the target count every second // This is the "high speed" part - the target increases by 11 every 1000ms setInterval(() => { targetCount += getRandomArbitrary(20,600); // The animateCounter loop is already running and will detect the new targetCount // and start animating towards it automatically. }, 1000);
